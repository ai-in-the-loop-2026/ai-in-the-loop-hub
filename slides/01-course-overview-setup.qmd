## What this course is about

This course combines hands-on Python development with a clear understanding of how large language models work in practice. You will:

- Develop **generative AI literacy**: understand what LLMs can and cannot reliably do, design effective prompts, and reason about reliability and evaluation
- Explore **AI-assisted programming**: coding assistants, "vibe coding," and agentic tools
- Build **applications that integrate LLMs** to solve real problems
- Consider **ethics, privacy, bias, and real-world risks**

---

## How we'll work

- **Course hub:** schedule, policies, resources, slides
- **Moodle:** announcements, grades
- **GitHub Classroom:** where you submit assignments
- **AI use:** required for many assignments, with transparency (see AI Use Policy)

---

## Tools for Week 1

- **VS Code** with extensions
- **Git + GitHub** for version control and submission (A0-A1)
- **Python 3.13.x** with `venv` + `pip` (A1)

---

## GitHub Classroom: what “submission” means

- Accept the assignment link
- Make changes in your assignment repo
- **Commit + push** to GitHub before the deadline
- Check ✅/❌ next to your latest commit for autograding results

## Next steps

1. Complete Initial Setup (Windows or macOS guide)
2. Follow GitHub Classroom Workflow Instructions (A0: skip steps 3-4):

    a. Accept A0 — Git and GitHub Fundamentals
    b. Clone your A0 repo
    c. Make changes (see README.md), commit + push
