## What you’ll be able to do by the end of this course

- Build software that calls model APIs (Gemini) safely and reliably
- Design tool-using and multi-step agent workflows
- Test and evaluate non-deterministic components
- Ship a final project with clear limitations + documentation

---

## How we’ll work

- **Course hub site:** schedule, policies, resources
- **GitHub Classroom repos:** where graded work happens
- **AI use:** allowed (and expected) with transparency

---

## Tools for Week 1

- Python 3.13.x
- `venv` + `pip`
- VS Code (recommended)
- Git + GitHub

---

## GitHub Classroom: what “submission” means

- Accept the assignment link
- Make changes in your assignment repo
- **Commit + push** to GitHub before the deadline
- Check ✅/❌ next to your latest commit for autograding results

---

## Setup checklist (high level)

1. Install VS Code
2. Install Git
3. Install Python 3.13.x
4. Clone your A0 repo
5. Create `.venv`, install dependencies
6. Commit + push a small change

---

## Expectations and norms

- You are responsible for keeping your repos private unless instructed otherwise
- Don’t commit secrets (API keys) — use `.env` locally
- Ask for help early; include exact error messages

---

## Next steps

- Read the syllabus + policies
- Complete Day 1 setup
- Start A0 (Setup Verification)
