## What this course is about (short version)

This course combines hands-on Python development with a clear understanding of how large language models work in practice. You will:

- Develop **generative AI literacy**: understand what LLMs can and cannot reliably do, design effective prompts, and reason about reliability and evaluation
- Explore **AI-assisted programming** across a spectrum: coding assistants, "vibe coding" workflows, and agentic tools that plan and execute multi-step tasks
- Build **applications that integrate LLMs** to solve real problems
- Consider **ethics, privacy, bias, and real-world risks** of AI systems

## Course "defaults" (so you don't have to guess)

- **Python:** 3.13.x (supported)  
- **Environment:** `venv` + `pip`  
- **Repo workflow (early weeks):** commit to `main`  
- **Autograding:** usually runs on push (check ✅/❌ on GitHub)
