This page is the **authoritative course schedule** and the main entry point for weekly materials.

- Slide decks are linked here (rendered HTML).
- Assignment invite links live on the [Assignments](assignments.qmd) page.

::: {.callout-note}
Dates below are placeholders until you finalize the semester calendar.  
The key requirement here: the **first Tuesday meeting** uses the first slide deck.

## Week 1

| Meeting | Topic | Slides | Due |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tuesday | Course overview + workflow setup | [Course Overview and Workflow Setup](slides/01-course-overview-setup.qmd) | — |
| Thursday | (Fill in) | — | — |

## Future weeks (placeholder)

Add additional weeks as you finalize topics and dates. A nice pattern is:

- one row per meeting
- links to slides
- links to relevant resources
- due items (assignment checkpoints) in the “Due” column
