## Course Description

This course offers an introduction to generative AI in modern software development, combining hands-on Python work with a clear conceptual understanding of how large language models behave in practice. Students develop/strengthen their Python skills while learning how these models work, what they can and cannot reliably do, and how to interact with them effectively. Emphasis is placed on generative AI literacy: designing prompts and interfaces that elicit useful behavior, understanding model limitations, and reasoning about reliability, uncertainty, and evaluation in AI-assisted systems, alongside broader considerations of ethics, privacy, bias, and real-world risks. The course also explores AI-assisted programming across a spectrum, from coding assistants and “vibe coding” workflows to agentic tools that plan and execute multi-step tasks, culminating in the creation of applications that integrate LLMs to solve real problems.

**Prerequisites:** CSCI 115, or CSCI 125, or MATH 313, or significant programming experience (with instructor permission)

## Instruction

Class meetings will combine brief, topic-driven instruction with hands-on work: we will use short mini-lectures and demonstrations to introduce new ideas and tools, then practice/explore them through programming/build assignments. Class time will also be dedicated to writing brief reflections and discussing broader generative AI concerns, such as AI ethics, privacy, bias, and real-world risks. Your final project group will organize and lead one of these discussions.

Outside of class, time will be spent completing build assignments, including documenting your process, reasoning, and learning, as you develop with AI tools. A major emphasis of the course is learning to read, evaluate, and improve code, so significant out-of-class effort should be dedicated to this, including preparing for individual and group code reviews. Throughout the semester you will also spend time outside of class consuming resources (reading articles, watching videos, etc.) in preparation for in class reflection and discussion.

The final weeks shift toward group project work: maintaining a well-organized project repository, preparing a polished presentation, producing a *public-facing*, portfolio-ready artifact, and completing a final group code review.

**Mandatory AI use.** Because this course is specifically about developing responsible, effective AI-assisted software development skills and creating software that integreates generative AI, students are **required** to use approved generative AI tools. Altenative assignments that do not require the use of generative AI *will not be available*.

**Course resources** will be available through our course webpage <https://ai-in-the-loop-2026.github.io/ai-in-the-loop-hub/> (primary) and Moodle (secondary). Assignments will be submitted using GitHub Classroom. Occasionally, we may also use Moodle for assignment submission.

**Other requirments.** Students are required to have the following:

- A fairly recent Mac or Windows laptop that you can install software on (iPads or Android tablets, Chromebooks, etc. are not sufficient/supported) for working on assignments in and out of class. Linux is welcome, but self-supported
- GitHub account for accepting and submitting assignments, developing and maintaining code repositories
- Personal Google account (separate from .edu account), like a GMail account, for accessing Google AI Studio and other resources. *A free account should be sufficient for this course*
- Software necessary for the course installed on your laptop. This includes VS Code with various extensions, Python development tools, various Python packages, Gemini CLI, etc. You do not need to set this up before the class starts
- An API key for using Gemini models. You do not need to set this up before the class starts. *The free tier should be sufficient for this course*
- A public website (github pages) "portfolio piece" that summarizes/demonstrates your final project. You do not need to set this up before the class starts, and there is no hosting cost

**Use of other generative AI tools.** We will primarily use Google/Gemini generative AI tools, which allow a substantial amount of free use. You are encouraged to responsibly explore other free and paid generative AI tools (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Anthropic or OpenAI API, Cursor, etc.) when it is appropriate in the course. However, your instructor will not typically provide technical support for these tools.


## Evaluation

Grades will be determined as follows:

| Assignment Type | Weight |
|----------------|--------|
| Attendance, in-class participation | 10% |
| Written reflections (10-15) | 5% |
| Buid assignments (8) | 20% |
| Individual code reviews (2) | 30% |
| Group-led discussion | 5% |
| Final project repository | 5% |
| Final project presentation | 5% |
| Final project "portfolio piece" | 5% |
| Final project group code review | 15% |


## Grading Scale

Your final letter grade will be determined using the following scale:

| Grade | Range | Grade | Range | Grade | Range |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| A | 93-100% | B- | 80-82% | D+ | 67-69% |
| A- | 90-92% | C+ | 77-79% | D | 63-66% |
| B+ | 87-89% | C | 73-76% | D- | 60-62% |
| B | 83-86% | C- | 70-72% | F | 0-59% |

## Attendance & Participation

Attendance is very important to your success in this class and is considered mandatory. If you must miss a class (illness, scheduled college event, family matters, etc.) you should inform your instructor ahead of time if at all possible.

## Final Exam Date

The final exam for this class (group code review) is on **Monday, May 4 from 12:30-2:30pm**.


**Special Note:** Do not arrange travel without confirming the dates of your final exams/projects, as dictated by the Office of the Provost.

## Schedule

**Important dates**

| Activity | Dates |
|---|---|
| Individual Code Review 1 | Feb. 19-20, 23 |
| Individual Code Review 2 | March 23-26 |
| Final Project Presentations | April 30 |
| Group Code Review | May 4 |

*Note:* You will set up an appointment for indvidual code reviews on one of the listed dates. Group code reviews will serve as our final exam--each project group will sign up for a time slot during the scheduled exam period.
