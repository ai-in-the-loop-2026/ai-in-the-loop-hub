# WR4 Writing Prompts: The Future of Jobs and Work

## Prompt 1

Think about the job or career you've been working toward. Based on what you read and heard this week, how might AI reshape that role by the time you're five years into it? Be specific — don't just say "AI will change things." What tasks might shrink or disappear? What new tasks might emerge? Are you more worried or more excited than you were before doing these readings, and why?

## Prompt 2

Across this week's readings, a pattern emerges: routine cognitive tasks are increasingly automatable, but certain human capabilities remain valuable. Reflect on your own education so far — both in this course and more broadly. Which skills and experiences are preparing you well for an AI-augmented workplace? Which feel less relevant than they used to? If you could redesign one aspect of your own education knowing what you know now, what would you change?
