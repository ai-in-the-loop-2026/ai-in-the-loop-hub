# Group-Led Discussions (GLD1–GLD4)

Starting in Week 10, each final project group will lead one in-class discussion on an AI-related topic. This page describes the requirements, deliverables, and timeline.

## Overview

Your group will choose a topic, curate resources, write reflection prompts, prepare discussion questions, and lead the class discussion. The instructor will create a written reflection assignment on GitHub Classroom and add your resources to the course website.

## Deliverables

### 1. Topic and Resources

**Due: at least one week before your discussion (earlier is better)**

Choose an AI-related topic that can sustain a good class discussion. Topics at the intersection of AI and society work well (e.g., AI and healthcare, AI and creative work, AI and faith, AI regulation), but you're not limited to that — any AI-related topic that enables thoughtful discussion is fair game. Then curate **3–4 resources** that the rest of the class will consume before the discussion. Your resources must:

- Include at least **two** of the following categories: text (articles), audio, video
- When possible, choose resources that represent **opposing or contrasting perspectives** — discussions are richer when the readings disagree
- Text articles must be from **high-quality sources** (e.g., *The Atlantic*, *The New Yorker*, *Wired*, *MIT Technology Review*, *Harvard Business Review*, NPR, PBS, peer-reviewed journals)
- All resources must be **accessible** to students (accessing through the college library's electronic collection is fine)
- Each resource needs a **title, author/source, and a 1–2 sentence description** explaining what it covers and why it's relevant
- **Read, watch, or listen to every resource yourself** before submitting them — you need to know the material well to lead a discussion on it

You may also include a few optional **"learn more" resources** for students who want to go deeper. These are not required but are a nice addition.

Model your resource descriptions on the ones provided for D1–D4 on the [Schedule](../schedule.qmd) page.

### 2. Writing Prompts

**Due: at least one week before your discussion**

Write **two writing prompts** that students will respond to as an in-class written reflection before the discussion begins. Strong prompts:

- Connect to the assigned resources and topic
- Invite students to reflect on their **own lives, experiences, or future plans**
- Cannot be answered with a quick, surface-level response
- Stimulate genuine thinking and introspection (not just summary of the readings)

Look at previous written reflections (WR1–WR4) for examples of effective prompts.

### 3. Discussion Questions

**Due: at least two days before your discussion**

Prepare **10–15 discussion questions** to drive the in-class conversation. Good discussion questions:

- Cover a **variety of angles** on the topic (don't cluster around one sub-theme)
- Include questions that students can **relate to their own lives and experiences**
- Are interesting and thought-provoking, not surface-level comprehension checks
- Draw on the assigned resources but also push beyond them
- Mix concrete/specific questions with bigger-picture ones

## Submission

Submit all deliverables **by email** to the instructor. Submitting more than a week in advance is encouraged — the instructor may ask you to revise your topic, swap a resource, or strengthen a prompt before the discussion date.

## Timeline Summary

| Deliverable | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Topic + resources (with descriptions) | At least 1 week before discussion |
| Two writing prompts | At least 1 week before discussion |
| 10–15 discussion questions | At least 2 days before discussion |

## What Happens Next

After receiving your materials, the instructor will:

1. Review and provide feedback (possibly requesting changes)
2. Create the written reflection assignment on GitHub Classroom
3. Add your resources and descriptions to the course website
4. Your group leads the in-class discussion on the scheduled date

## Tips

- **Start early.** The instructor may ask for revisions, so give yourself time.
- **Pick a topic your group genuinely cares about.** Enthusiasm is contagious.
- **Test your resources.** Make sure links work and that articles aren't behind inaccessible paywalls.
- **Prepare more questions than you think you'll need.** Some questions land better than others, and you want options.
- **Plan for facilitation.** Think about how you'll structure the discussion — who opens, how you'll handle quiet moments, etc.
