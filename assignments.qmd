## FAQ: “My assignment says Not Submitted”
GitHub Classroom submission status is often tied to the assignment deadline/cutoff.
In most cases, **pushing commits before the deadline** is what matters.

If you have pushed and are unsure, check:

- your repo shows your latest commit on `main`
- autograding checks (✅/❌) next to your commit (if enabled)
