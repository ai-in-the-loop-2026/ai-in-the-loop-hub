### Accommodations

If you have questions about access or are a student needing accommodations for a disability, please contact me. I will ask that you connect with [Disability and Accessibility Resources](http://hope.edu/dar) if you haven't already.

### Academic Honesty & Integrity

> As it seeks to fulfill its mission, the Hope College community assumes each of its members will operate with integrity and honesty, with a sense of personal responsibility, and with mutual trust and concern toward others in all facets of the life of the college. In order to apply this principle to academic life in a fair and consistent manner, the following policies have been adopted to clarify the expectations regarding conduct, and to establish a set of procedures for dealing with situations which violate these expectations.
> 
> *-Preamble, Code for Academic Integrity at Hope College*

More information about Academic Integrity can be found at: [https://hope.edu/offices/student-development/policies-resources/student-handbook.html#academic-integrity](https://hope.edu/offices/student-development/policies-resources/student-handbook.html#academic-integrity)

### Short-Term Absence Policy

Hope College recognizes that life events may unexpectedly interrupt an academic semester, including needing time away from campus. Thus, the purpose of a formal process for short-term, temporary absence is to improve the student experience so that they may continue progress in a course of study if unable to attend and participate in person while seeking treatment and/or recovering from a medical or mental health event, a family emergency/crisis, or other extraordinary circumstance. [View the entire Short-Term Temporary Absence Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1agX_gYL4MCJHS8VkFbvedzioAXR9zIcv/view).

If a situation arises (such as medical treatment or family bereavement) that requires a longer absence, please complete the [short-term absence form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?HopeCollege&layout_id=31) to ensure that appropriate documentation is provided to the CARE team.

### Excessive Absence Policy

Hope College encourages students to regularly attend class and allows faculty to develop their own classroom attendance policies. Attendance and participation in class are vital components of a residential college experience. [View the entire Excessive Absence Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jpxXdEM9KrXDGz35oSVHroYWDosGuLh4nx91CFEgLQ/edit).

The Hope Health Center does not provide medical excuses for missed classes, exams, or assignments, as medical conditions are confidential and often not verifiable. This is in alignment with the [Academic Medical Excuse Policy](https://hope.edu/offices/health-center/) and consistent with the recommendations of the American College Health Association. Thus, instructors cannot request documentation from the Hope Health Center.

**Special Note:** Only arrange holiday travel after confirming the dates of your final exams/projects, as the Office of the Provost dictates.

### Student Complaint

Hope College is committed to the appropriate resolution of complaints as efficiently and effectively as possible. Providing a mechanism to hear complaints allows us to improve our services. Students are encouraged to speak directly to other Hope community members to resolve conflict and/or seek an informal resolution of the dispute directly with the other community member(s) whenever possible. Please use this [Complaint form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?HopeCollege&layout_id=10) when such a resolution is impossible.

### Safety & Emergency Preparedness

Students should dial **911** (the United States' primary emergency response system) from any phone if they or someone else experiences a medical or mental health emergency. Students can also contact Hope College's Campus Safety Office **(616-395-7770)** in any kind of emergency situation, and Campus Safety will contact the necessary emergency response service. You can learn more about [specific emergency instructions](https://hope.edu/offices/campus-safety/emergency-information/index.html) on their webpage. Students can sign up for emergency text message alerts at [**plus.hope.edu**](https://plus.hope.edu).

### Inclement Weather

Campus Safety sends emergency notification texts, including notices of weather-related closures, via the **HOPE ALERT system**. A decision to close campus offices and cancel classes is typically announced before **6:30 AM**. More information regarding [inclement weather notifications](https://hope.edu/offices/campus-safety/emergency-information/index.html#:~:text=THREATS%C2%A0%26%20TRAIN%20DERAILMENT-,SEVERE%20WEATHER,-Hope%20Alert%C2%A0) can be found on Campus Safety's webpage.

### Academic Assistance Statement

The Academic Success Center (ASC) offers all students various free services (e.g., tutoring, testing strategies, time management resources). The [ASC](https://hope.edu/offices/academic-success-center/) is located in Van Zoeren Hall--immediately adjacent to the Van Wylen Library second-floor entrance. To contact the ASC send an email to **asc@hope.edu** or call **616-395-7830**.

### Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)

Students may experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and their personal well-being. These may include academic pressures, relationship challenges, alcohol or other drugs, financial concerns, identity development, body image, etc.

If you are experiencing similar concerns, we encourage you to seek support. Hope College Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is a free and confidential resource. Call **616-395-7945**, or visit the top floor of the Bultman Student Center to find the right support for you.

If the source of your stressors is academic, please contact me or academic advising to find solutions together.
