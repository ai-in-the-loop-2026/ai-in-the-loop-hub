### Build Assignments

On Build Assignments, you are encouraged to discuss concepts, approaches, and code with your classmates. All code you submit must be written by you, with or without AI assistance—not copied from classmates, etc. You are responsible for understanding and being able to explain all code you submit.

### Individual Code Reviews

You may seek feedback from classmates while preparing for Individual Code Reviews, including feedback on your slides. However, that feedback must not extend to writing any part of your presentation.

### Written Reflections

Written Reflections are to be completed individually without collaboration.

### Final Project and Group Code Reviews

The Final Project is a group effort. You may discuss ideas with classmates outside your group, but all code must be written by your group members (with or without AI assistance). Each group member must understand and be able to explain all code in the repository.

You may seek feedback from classmates outside your group on your presentation, Portfolio Piece, and Group Code Review slides, but that feedback must not extend to writing any part of these deliverables.

### Final Project Group Evaluation

Each group member is expected to contribute fairly to the Final Project. At the end of the project, each group member will complete a confidential evaluation of their own and their teammates' contributions. If a group member did not contribute fairly, their grade may be adjusted accordingly.
