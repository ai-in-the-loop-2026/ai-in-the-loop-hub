It is my intention that every student has the opportunity to grow and flourish in this class. A crucial part of this is that each and every student deserves to feel safe and that she or he belongs in the class. Each of us has a role in working toward creating an inclusive environment, even if doing so requires us to speak out and causes us discomfort sometimes.

The diversity that students bring to this course is viewed as an asset, and this course will function in a manner that respects and values that diversity, including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, nationality, religion, and culture. Please let me know if anything said or done by the instructor or other students in the class leads to hurt or offense. Such actions, even when unintentional, are deserving of attention.

Racist and discriminatory policies and ideas present obstacles to student flourishing and do not reflect the values of this course. It is my intention that this course and its policies promote equal representation and equitable outcomes among groups. Please let me know if you have ideas for improving this course or its policies in ways that make it more effective for you or for other students or groups. I value your perspective, and I take it seriously.
