### Late Build Assignments

You may have a single late submission (at most 48 hours late) of a Build Assignment (excluding A5 and A8) without penalty. To use this late submission, you must notify the instructor by email before the assignment due date and time. If you do not notify me in advance, late submissions will be penalized according to the standard late policy below. A5 and A8 must be submitted by the deadline to facilitate Code Reviews.

After using your single late submission, any further late submissions for Build Assignments will be penalized at a rate of 10% of the total assignment points per 12-hour period (or fraction thereof) late. For example, if an assignment is worth 100 points and you submit it 26 hours late, you will lose 30 points (10% for the first 12 hours, 10% for the second 12 hours, and another 10% for the additional 2 hours).

### Written Reflections

Written Reflections will be completed in class, and late work will not be accepted. Your lowest Written Reflection score will be dropped at the end of the semester to accommodate for any unforeseen circumstances.

### Code Reviews, Group-Led Discussion, and Final Project Presentation

Code Reviews, the class discussion your group leads, and the Final Project Presentation must be completed at the scheduled times.

### Final Project Deadlines

Submissions related to the final project (e.g., proposal, code submission, portfolio piece, etc.) must be submitted by the specified deadlines. Late submissions will be penalized at a rate of 20% of the total points per 12-hour period (or fraction thereof) late.

### Exceptions

Exceptions to the late work policies outlined above will only be made for excused absences, as defined by Hope College policies. If you believe you have a valid reason for an exception, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss your situation.
